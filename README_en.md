* This open-source project aims to train an ultra-small language model MiniMind with approximately 64M parameters entirely from scratch, using only 3 CNY in cost and 2 hours of training time.
* The MiniMind series is extremely lightweight, with the smallest version on the main branch being approximately $\frac{1}{2700}$ the size of GPT-3, striving to enable even ordinary personal GPUs to quickly complete training and reproduction.
* The project also open-sources the minimalist structure and complete training pipeline of large models, covering the entire process code for MoE, data cleaning, Pretraining, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), LoRA, RLHF (DPO), RLAIF (PPO / GRPO / CISPO), Tool Use, Agentic RL, Adaptive Thinking, and Model Distillation.
* MiniMind has also been extended to a visual multimodal version [MiniMind-V](https://github.com/jingyaogong/minimind-v), a diffusion language model (MiniMind-dLM), and a linear attention model (MiniMind-Linear), See [Discussion](https://github.com/jingyaogong/minimind/discussions) for details.
* All core algorithm code in the project is implemented from scratch using native PyTorch, without relying on high-level abstract interfaces provided by third-party libraries.
* This is not only a full-stage open-source reproduction project for large language models, but also a tutorial oriented towards LLM introduction and practice.
* We hope this project can provide a reproducible, understandable, and extensible starting point for more people, to share the joy of creation together and promote the progress of the broader AI community.

> Note: This project is open-sourced under the Apache 2.0 license and is completely free. "2 hours" refers to the measured time to run `1 epoch` of the SFT stage on a single NVIDIA 3090, and "3 CNY" refers to the corresponding GPU rental cost for that duration.

> **Personal note:** I'm using this fork primarily to study the GRPO and DPO training stages. My focus areas:
> - **GRPO**: Understanding how group relative policy optimization differs from PPO in terms of variance reduction and reward normalization.
> - **DPO**: Comparing DPO vs PPO stability during fine-tuning on small models like this one.
> - I'm running experiments on a single RTX 4090 with a reduced batch size of 4 to fit within VRAM constraints.
